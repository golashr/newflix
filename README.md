# NewFlix Movie WebApp

This complete application shows the available new movies in an aggregated fashion while pulling movies data from movie broadcaster providers e.g. Cinema World and Film World. The project contains 3 microservices e.g. cinemaworld, filmworld and webjetserver and one front end named webjet.

It contains a docker-compose file which can be used to deploy the entire application seemlessly on any given box.
